# configs
All of my scripts for installing certain sets of software in arch linux.

### Instructions
* You can either customize your system by running scripts in the root of the
   `Arch-Setup` directory, or you can `cd` into the MachinePresets directory
   to have the scripts chosen for you.

### Errors
* All error logs will be written to `/tmp/archsetuperrors.log` (which will be 
  deleted at reboot)
